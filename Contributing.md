# Contributing to SEPARATE

## Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please do at least a cursory check that the
issue has not already been reported by searching the Issues section of this
GitHub repository. If it has, feel free to add a comment to the existing issue
rather than opening a new one.

### Submitting a Bug Report

Bugs are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've
determined you've found a new bug, please open a
[new issue](https://github.com/WatershedsWildfireResearchCollaborative/SEPARATE/issues).

Alternatively, you may email the authors.

When reporting a bug, please explain the problem clearly and include enough
detail for us to reproduce it. The following information is especially helpful:

- **A clear and descriptive title** that summarizes the issue.
- **Exact steps needed to reproduce the problem.**
- **A minimal example** (small dataset or short code snippet) that triggers the bug.
- **The behavior you observed** and how it differs from what you expected.
- **Any error messages or traceback output.**

When applicable, please also include:

- **SEPARATE version** (listed in the GUI and code header).
- **Python version** (e.g., 3.11.9).
- **Operating system** (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **How you installed SEPARATE** (pip, source code, or standalone .exe/.app).

## Submitting Changes

We welcome improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

If you would like to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1. **Open a GitHub issue** or **email the authors** describing what you plan to add or change.  
   This helps ensure everyone is aligned before development begins.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g., `feature/new-metric`, `bugfix/edge-case`).
3. After implementing the change, **open a pull request** against the `main` branch.
4. In your pull request description:
   - Summarize the problem your change addresses.
   - Describe your solution.
   - Reference the related issue number (e.g., `Closes #12`).
   - Include screenshots or example outputs if helpful.

## Adding New Features

If you plan to add substantial functionality:

- Open an issue or email the authors so we can discuss design, scope, and consistency.
- Follow existing coding style and folder organization.
- Include docstrings and comments describing the purpose of new functions.
- When possible, add unit tests or example usage demonstrating the new behavior.

## Code Style

SEPARATE aims for readable, maintainable Python code:

- Follow **PEP 8** conventions.
- Use clear and descriptive function names.
- Add comments where logic may not be immediately obvious.
